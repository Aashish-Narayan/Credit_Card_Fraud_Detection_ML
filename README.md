# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_ML
A Machine Learning-based Credit Card Fraud Detection system built using Logistic Regression. The dataset was highly imbalanced, so under-sampling was applied for better training. Achieved 92.38% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions with Python and Scikit-learn.
