# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_ML
A Machine Learning-based Credit Card Fraud Detection system built using Logistic Regression. The dataset was highly imbalanced, so under-sampling was applied for better training. Achieved 92.38% accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions with Python and Scikit-learn.

#  **Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Machine Learning**.
A highly imbalanced dataset was used, and **Under-Sampling** techniques were applied to improve training effectiveness.

##  **Project Overview**

Credit card fraud is a major challenge in the financial sector.
To address this, I built a classification model using **Logistic Regression** that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or genuine.

##  **Technologies & Libraries Used**

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Scikit-learn**

  * train_test_split
  * LogisticRegression
  * accuracy_score

## ⚙️ **Approach**

###  1. Data Preprocessing

* Loaded the dataset
* Handled missing values

###  2. Handling Imbalanced Data

The dataset had very few fraud cases → highly imbalanced.
To fix this, **Under-Sampling** was applied to create a balanced training set.

###  3. Model Training

* Used **Logistic Regression**
* Trained on balanced data
* Achieved an accuracy of **92.38%**

###  4. Evaluation

* Accuracy Score
* Classification report (if added)
* Confusion matrix (if added)

##  **Model Accuracy**

> **Final Accuracy:** ⭐ **92.38%**

##  **Key Learnings**

* Handling **unbalanced datasets**
* Data preprocessing and transformation
* Logistic Regression implementation
* Improving model performance
* Fraud detection concepts

---

##  **Future Improvements**

* Try SMOTE (Over-sampling)
* Experiment with tree-based models
* Deploy using Flask/Streamlit
* Add ROC & AUC performance metrics
